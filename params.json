Moar Chow will allow you to browse all the menus on campus, view the location restaurants and food trucks. Users will also be able to rate/review vendors and save their favorite dishes.\r\n\r\n# Completed\r\n + UHM CAS Login\r\n + Website general layout\r\n + Landing Page\r\n\r\n# In Progress\r\n + Google Maps \r\n \r\n# Planned\r\n + Rate and review vendors\r\n + User profiles that allow saving favorite vendors and dishes\r\n\r\n# Meteor Deployment\r\n + http://moarchow.meteorapp.com/\r\n \r\n## Milestones\r\n + https://github.com/moarchow/moarchow/projects/1\r\n + https://github.com/moarchow/moarchow/projects/2\r\n \r\n# Designers\r\n + **Michael Mangrobang** - Computer Science Undergraduate\r\n  + Learn to work on an actual group project with multiple people contributing code.\r\n  + Having already learned HTML, PHP, CSS and JS, I want to improve in those fields. I also enjoyed learning PHP, so improving on Mongo is a plus.\r\n  + The only new thing to me in this final project are Mongo and Meteor.\r\n + **William Siu** - Computer Science Undergraduate\r\n  + The experience to work on big projects with other people to get my feet wet for later things like game designing.\r\n  +  I want to practice with the javascript part in meteor for a better knowledge of being able to add to database and pull things from it & updating better with it. Seems more hectic than with html.\r\n  +  Before this class, i took ICS 215 where I learned a bunch of programming languages like javascript & html, but by the time this class started, I had very few vague memories of it. First time working with GitHub, meteor, and in a group project\r\n + **Kasey Hagi** - Computer Engineering Undergraduate\r\n  + Experience collaborating using github.\r\n  + I want to practice using JavaScript and underscore.\r\n  + Most of my experience is in C++ and Java. This is my first project working on UI and using GitHub.\r\n + **Ryan Theriot** - Computer Science Undergraduate\r\n  + Learn how to work and manage a larger project on GitHub with multiple people contributing code.  \r\n  + I've worked with the HTML, PHP, SQL style of database interaction before and I'm interested in learning more about the Mongo/Meteor database setup. \r\n  + I've managed projects on GitHub before, and created GitHub Wiki's...but never with four people contributing code. I've worked with HTML, CSS, and JS  before this class.\r\n  \r\n## Meeting Time\r\n + Fridays at Noon\r\n \r\n## Logo Drafts\r\n<img class=\"ui medium image\" style=\"height: 200px;\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow/master/app/public/images/need-real-food.png\">\r\n\r\n## Web page examples\r\n\r\n### Landing Page\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/homepage1.png\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/homepage2.png\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/homepage3.png\">\r\n\r\n### Home Page\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/home.png\">\r\n\r\n### Vendors Page\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/vendors.png\">\r\n\r\n### Vendor Page\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/vendor.png\">\r\n\r\n### Map\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/map.png\">\r\n",
