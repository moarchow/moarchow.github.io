Moar Chow will allow UH students and faculty to browse all the menus on campus, view vendor locations, rate vendors, save their favorite vendors, and search for food by cusine type.\r\n\r\n[**Meteor Deployment**](http://moarchow.meteorapp.com/)\r\n\r\n# Guided Tour\r\n## Landing Page\r\n##### First you have log in with your UH CAS login information by clicking the Log In button.\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/milestone3/landing.jpg\">\r\n\r\n##### Once you have clicked the log in you will have to accept Moar Chow's Terms and Conditions.\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/milestone3/terms.jpg\">\r\n\r\n##### After you have accepted the Terms and Condtitions you can now login with your UH CAS login information.\r\n<img class=\"ui medium right floated image\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarchow/moarchow.github.io/master/images/milestone3/login.jpg\">\r\n\r\n## Home Page\r\n##### Once logged in you are taken to your home page.
