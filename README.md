# Designers
 + **Michael Mangrobang** - Computer Science Undergraduate
  + Learn to work on an actual group project with multiple people contributing code.
  + Having already learned HTML, PHP, CSS and JS, I want to improve in those fields. I also enjoyed learning PHP, so improving on Mongo is a plus.
  + The only new thing to me in this final project are Mongo and Meteor.
 + **William Siu** - Computer Science Undergraduate
  + The experience to work on big projects with other people to get my feet wet for later things like game designing.
  +  I want to practice with the javascript part in meteor for a better knowledge of being able to add to database and pull things from it & updating better with it. Seems more hectic than with html.
  +  Before this class, i took ICS 215 where I learned a bunch of programming languages like javascript & html, but by the time this class started, I had very few vague memories of it. First time working with GitHub, meteor, and in a group project
 + **Kasey Hagi** - Computer Engineering Undergraduate
  + Experience collaborating using github.
  + I want to practice using JavaScript and underscore.
  + Most of my experience is in C++ and Java. This is my first project working on UI and using GitHub.
 + **Ryan Theriot** - Computer Science Undergraduate
  + Learn how to work and manage a larger project on GitHub with multiple people contributing code.  
  + I've worked with the HTML, PHP, SQL style of database interaction before and I'm interested in learning more about the Mongo/Meteor database setup. 
  + I've managed projects on GitHub before, and created GitHub Wiki's...but never with four people contributing code. I've worked with HTML, CSS, and JS  before this class.
