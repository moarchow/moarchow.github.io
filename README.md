# About
There are many food choices on UH Manoa's campus and knowing what each vendor serves and when can be confusing. Moar Chow will allow UH students and faculty to browse all the menus on campus, view vendor locations, rate vendors, save their favorite vendors, and search for food by cusine type.

## Home Page
#### The home page is the first page users see after logging into Moar Chow. The tab for this page is located in the top menu. Here users can see their saved chow spots and search for chow by cusine.
#### My Favorite Chow Spots - Listed here are all the vendors a user has saved. Users can see if the vendor is open (gree is open, red is closed), what rating they have given the vendor, and unfavorite the vendor.
#### Search For Chow - Users can search for new chow by cuisine type. Here we can see someone is searching for coffee and listed below are all the spots that serve coffee.

## Vendor Page

#### Users can leave a rating for the vendor on the bottom left of the page.

# Initial User Study
Five current University of Hawaii students and one person who use to attend there were recruited to use our site. Though not in person, the recruiter did a one on one talk/chat through an online chat system to what they could do in our site. After a one on one chat with each one, each person gave back a feedback about the website.

Overall, they all said it was a good app. Title is creative, the app is pretty simple and clean to the point where anyone would be able to use. The food items and prices are accurate as well as hours of operation. One person liked . However, the negative feedback was a little diverse. One suggested that we remove the descriptions of the vendor in the map page so that it is easier to see the other locations. A couple said being unable to comment to go along with the ratings was a bummer. A person said that not having a search bar to type in what to search instead of having a fixed dropdown menu. The general negative feedback is that there is not enough aesthetic appeal to the website aside from the landing page. One suggested maybe having a picture of the store front for each vendor so people know what to look for when they reach to the location. Another said to have more of an aesthetic appeal so people feel captivated while browsing vendors and their menus. Other than that, they all said it is a pretty solid app.</p>
