# About Moar Chow
There are many food choices on campus at UH Manoa and knowing what each place serves and when can be confusing. Moar Chow will allow you to browse all the menus on campus, view the location restaurants and food trucks. Users will also be able to rate/review vendors and save their favorite dishes.

# Designers
 + **Michael Mangrobang** - Computer Science Undergraduate
  + Learn to work on an actual group project with multiple people contributing code.
  + Having already learned HTML, PHP, CSS and JS, I want to improve in those fields. I also enjoyed learning PHP, so improving on Mongo is a plus.
  + The only new thing to me in this final project are Mongo and Meteor.
 + **William Siu** - Computer Science Undergraduate
  + The experience to work on big projects with other people to get my feet wet for later things like game designing.
  +  I want to practice with the javascript part in meteor for a better knowledge of being able to add to database and pull things from it & updating better with it. Seems more hectic than with html.
  +  Before this class, i took ICS 215 where I learned a bunch of programming languages like javascript & html, but by the time this class started, I had very few vague memories of it. First time working with GitHub, meteor, and in a group project
 + **Kasey Hagi** - Computer Engineering Undergraduate
  + Experience collaborating using github.
  + I want to practice using JavaScript and underscore.
  + Most of my experience is in C++ and Java. This is my first project working on UI and using GitHub.
 + **Ryan Theriot** - Computer Science Undergraduate
  + Learn how to work and manage a larger project on GitHub with multiple people contributing code.  
  + I've worked with the HTML, PHP, SQL style of database interaction before and I'm interested in learning more about the Mongo/Meteor database setup. 
  + I've managed projects on GitHub before, and created GitHub Wiki's...but never with four people contributing code. I've worked with HTML, CSS, and JS  before this class.
